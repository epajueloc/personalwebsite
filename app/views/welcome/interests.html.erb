      <hr>

        <div class="col-md-4">
        <p>I'm a Finance and Economics double major at the University of Notre Dame and am very passionate about sports and entrepreneurship. I'm the President of the Entrepreneurship Society of Notre Dame and love learning about new ways in which technology can shape our lives. I'm currently developing an iOS app with the goal of making it a profitable business in the future.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-4">
        <p>I'm originally from Lima, Peru and even though I love the people, the music, and the food back home, I decided that studying in the United States would be best for my personal and professional development. I chose to come to Notre Dame not only because of its excellent academic program and prestigious business school, but also because of the spiritual aspect that it offers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-4">
        <p>I believe that businesses are the best way to give back to society. Not only can a business affect its employees and their families by helping in their professional development and improving their living standards, but it can also help change whole communities. In the same way, it has the power to achieve change in the world with philantrophic activities and disruptive technologies.</p>

       <h5>Diviso Fondos<h6>June 2015 - August 2015 | Lima, Peru</h6></h5>
       <hr>
        <p>Following my freshman year, I interned in the Sales and Trading division of Diviso Fondos, an Investment Company in Peru. It was my first exposure to the financial world and I learned way more than I expected.</p>
        <p>I elaborated and analyzed daily and monthly reports related to the performance of the mutual funds. I consolidated the data into written reports, and created presentations that were used by the CEO at Board meetings.</p>
        <p>I supported the porfolio managers at the trading desk in their transactions by providing relevant information obtained from a Bloomberg terminal.</p><br/>

        <h5>Duodecim<h6>April 2014 - August 2014 | Lima, Peru</h6></h5>
        <hr>

        <p>After finishing the IB Diploma, I attended college in Lima for a semester (where I studied Industrial Engineering in order to try something different from what I was going to study at Notre Dame) and also started Duodecim with a group of college students in order to provide funds for service projects organized by the Church.</p>
        <p>Besides helping school kids improve their grades and understanding of several subjects, we also donated our incomes to undertake social projects. I gained experience as a tutor and also organized activities in poor communities, especially with young kids.</p><br/>

        <h5>Ladrillos Fortes<h6>January 2014 - April 2014 | Lima, Peru</h6></h5>
        <hr>

        <p>Ladrillos Fortes is a Peruvian brick company with factories in four different cities in Peru. I worked as a Sales and Marketing Intern, and my main duty was to help the division unify information accross the Sales, Marketing and Production Departments to optimize the planning strategy of the sale of ceramic bricks, by reducing remaining stock and fulfilling customer orders in time.</p>
        <p>This was to be achieved by researching new markets through one-on-one conversations, phone calls, surveys and visiting retailers.</p>

      <div class="col-md-4">

       <h5>iXperience<h6>Summer 2015 & Summer 2016 | Cape Town, South Africa</h6></h5>
       <hr>
        <p>I attended two intenstive, 160-hour coding camps in Cape Town. I met people from top universities worldwide, ate amazing food, discovered awesome places and, most importantly, learned how to code.</p>
        <p>I designed and created a dynamic web application called Bridge, using Ruby on Rails, HTML, and CSS. Bridge is a platform designed to connect clients directly to freelancers, inspired by the increasing unemployment in South Africa. Check it out! <font color="blue"><u>(www.bridgeconnect.co)</u></font></p>
        <p>I also developed an iOS app that helps reduce meat intake by displaying a dynamic calendar that keeps track of your goals, collaborating with the UX Design and PM teams.</p><br/>

        <h5>SIBC International Case Study<h6>October 2015 | Sao Paulo, Brazil</h6></h5>
        <hr>

        <p>During Fall Break of my sophomore year, I traveled with a delegation of six other Notre Dame students to Brazil to participate in a program with workshops, lectures, and cultural immersion, as well as a case study with students from the University of Campinas.</p>
        <p>It was a great opportunity to work on an international topic with students from diverse backgrounds and to develop global business knowledge and skills. I learned in depth about Brazil's socio-economic situation from the perspective of students, professors, tour guides, and even from the taxi drivers (with whom I got to practice my Portuguese as well!).</p><br/>

        <h5>Round Square International Conference<h6>2012 | Nairobi, Kenya</h6></h5>
        <hr>

        <p>My senior year in high school, I attended a conference held in Nairobi with around 300 delegates from around the world. Before attending the actual conference, we went to Mombasa (a beach nearby) and we also went on a safari. This made my first time in Africa an amazing experience.</p>
        <p>The theme of the conference was "No existence without coexistence", which raised awareness of Africa's socio-political issues. I stayed in the house of Kenyian students, and attended several workshops where we discussed our different views of topics related to the theme. We also helped build school classrooms for poor children.</p>

        <h5>Student International Business Council<h6>Member</h6></h5>
        <hr>

        <p>I got involved in SIBC on my first semester in college, and did projects in the finance and consulting divisions. One of the projects had us propose a group solution to Bain for the problems that American Eagle was facing with their revenues, analyzing adjacent markets and benchmarking the company with its competition. The other project had us simulate the work done by investment banking analysts through qualitative and quantitative analysis related to an IPO, utilizing public information and market research.</p><br/>

        <h5>Other clubs and activities on campus<h6>Active</h6></h5>
        <hr>

        <p>Besides the two clubs I have already mentioned, I am also part of others clubs such as ALPFA (Association of Latino Professionals For America), the Wall Street Club, and the Latino Honors Society. These clubs have regular meetings and networking events to which I attend depending on the subject to be discussed. For example, in 2015 I traveled with the WSJ to Chicago to visit five financial firms (JP Morgan, Northern Trust, Baird, William Blair and Grosvenor).</p>
